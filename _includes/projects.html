    <p class="text-justify"> I am a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Manchester. In my research work on a Dual Grid Hybrid RANS/LES model, I am developing novel methods to simulate turbulent flows of fluids in a cost-effective way. For this project, I have been awarded a studentship, funded by the EPSRC and EDF Energy.

I am currently holding an EASA Private Pilot Licence PPL (A) for Single Engine Piston Airplanes with an Instrument Rating (IR), a FAA PPL(A) IR for Single and Multi Engine Piston, and a German Glider Pilot Licence, with around 350 hours of experience in total.
