    <p class="text-justify"> I am currently a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Manchester. In my research work on a Dual Grid Hybrid RANS/LES model, I am developing novel methods to simulate turbulent flows of fluids in a cost-effective way by coupling statistical Reynolds-Averaging Navier-Stokes (RANS) methods with turbulence-resolving Large Eddy Simulation (LES). I have presented project outcomes at various stages, including scientific conferences, software user meetings and EDF Energy researcher events (see my <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philipp_Nguyen" target="_blank">researchgate profile</a> for up-to-date outcomes). For this project, I have been awarded a studentship, funded by the EPSRC and EDF Energy.

    <h3> Higher Education </h3>
    <!-- <ul>

    </ul> -->
    <p class="text-justify"> I have earned my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and Master of Science (M.Sc.) degrees in Aerospace Engineering at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I have specialised in Aerodynamics and Aircraft Design, with outcomes on <a href="https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2015-01-2401/" target="_blank">innovative aircraft ground handling</a> in collaboration with the aerospace technology think tank Bauhaus Luftfahrt, unsteady CFD simulations on the VFE-2 delta wing configuration, and on compressor flows. In parallel, I have done a second M.Sc. degree in Industrial Engineering at TUM, as I am also highly interested in understanding relations in business. I had the opportunity to write my Master's Thesis at the University of Zurich (UZH) with an Erasmus scholarship.

    <!-- <ul>

    <p class="text-justify"> My big passion is everything what has to do with airplanes. I am currently holding an EASA Private Pilot Licence PPL (A) for Single Engine Piston Airplanes with an Instrument Rating (IR), a FAA PPL(A) IR for Single and Multi Engine Piston, and a German Glider Pilot Licence, with around 350 hours of experience in total.

    <p class="text-justify"> Playing a music instrument is one of my favourite things to do when I have some free time. I have been playing the piano for almost 20 years now. Since 2017, I have started taking weekly lessons for the trumpet.
